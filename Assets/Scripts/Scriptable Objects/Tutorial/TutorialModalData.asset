  TunnelingWindowDescriptions:
  - If 2 similar tiles are blocked by a different tile, they pass through the middle
    tile and merge with each other.
  - Notice how the both "2" tiles are blocked by the "8" tile.
  - One of the "2" tiles just tunnelled through the "8" tile!
  - This is inspired by the quantum phenomenon (called tunnelling!) where a particle
    passes through a barrier that it shouldn't be able to cross according to classical
    physics.
  - Quantum tunneling is possible because particles in quantum mechanics behave as
    probabilistic waves, allowing them to have a finite chance of passing through
    energy barriers, even if they lack the classical energy to overcome them.
  - Perform tunnelling merges to fill up the competency counter!
  - You've mastered the tunneling merge! Next, let's learn about merge thresholds.
  - Sometimes, tiles will not be able to merge if their value is not high enough
    for tunnelling to work. .\n
  - Uh-oh! The "2" tiles are not able to tunnel through because their value is not
    high enough.
  - Tiles must have a minimum threshold in order to be able to tunnel through.
  - See? The "16" tile was within the tunneling threshold!
  - You have completed the Tunnelling tutorial!\nYou can now freely play the game
    with tunnelling enabled.\nOnce you're comfortable using tunnelling, hit the Main
    Menu button to return to the main menu.

  - Occasionally, you might see a tile with a green border on the board.
  - This is a superposition tile!\n\nA superposition tile has a chance of changing
    its value each time it moves!
  - Move around the superposition tile to see how it works!\nClick continue once
    you're done.
  - 'This mechanic is inspired by the concept of "superposition" in quantum mechanics.\n\nImagine
    flipping a coin. We know that when the coin lands, it can either be in the heads
    state or in the tails state. But what state is it in while it''s flipping?\n\nWhile
    flipping, we can say that the coin is in a superposition, meaning that it is
    both heads and tails at the same time.\n\nSimilarly, a quantum system can be
    in superposition, meaning that it can be in multiple states at once. '
  - However, once we observe the system (when the coin lands), the superposition
    resolves into one of the possible outcomes. This is what is happening with our
    tile.
  - Superposition tiles can get you out of a tough spot. In this case, there is only
    one space left to move on the board, which puts us very close to game over.\n\nPress
    continue to see how the superposition tile can help us.
  - The superposition tile can be merged with the "2" tile right above it!
  - In this case, the superposition tile helped to create more space and avoid a
    game over!
  - You have completed the Superposition tutorial!\n\nYou can now freely play the
    game with superposition enabled.\nOnce you're comfortable using superposition,
    hit the Main Menu button to return to the main menu.

  EntanglementWindowDescriptions:
  - Look at the highlighted button! This is the Entanglement button.\n\nThe Entanglement
    button can be used to choose 2 tiles and make them the same!
  - Click "Entangle". You will see that the board changes.\n\nOnce the board has
    changed, click the "8" tile to select it. You can see that the "8" tile is selected
    when it turns red.\n\nThen, select the 2 tile.
  - Look! The "2" tile turned into an "8" tile!
  - This mechanic is inspired by the concept of quantum entanglement.\n\nIn a quantum
    system, a unique phenomenon can occur where two or more particles become connected
    (or entangled) in such a way that they instantly affect each other, regardless
    of the physical distance between them. They can even be separated by light-years
    at opposite ends of the universe and still influence one another instantaneously.
  - Entanglement is a powerful tool and for that reason, there is a cost for using
    it.\n\nNotice that the entangle button now shows the points required to use it.
