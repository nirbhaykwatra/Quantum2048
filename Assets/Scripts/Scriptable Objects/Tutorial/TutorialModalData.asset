  TunnelingWindowTitles:
  - Tunneling Merge
  - Tunnelling Merge
  - What just happened?
  - What is Quantum Tunneling?
  TunnelingWindowDescriptions:
  - If 2 similar tiles are blocked by a different tile, they pass through the middle
    tile and merge with each other.
  - Notice how the both 2 tiles are blocked by the 8 tile.
  - Both of the 2 tiles just tunnelled through the 8 tile!
  - This is inspired by the quantum phenomenon (called tunnelling!) where a particle
    passes through a barrier that it shouldn't be able to cross according to classical
    physics.
  - Quantum tunneling is possible because particles in quantum mechanics behave as
    probabilistic waves, allowing them to have a finite chance of passing through
    energy barriers, even if they lack the classical energy to overcome them.
