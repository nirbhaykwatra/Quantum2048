  TunnelingWindowDescriptions:
  - If 2 similar tiles are blocked by a different tile, they pass through the middle
    tile and merge with each other.
  - Notice how the both "2" tiles are blocked by the "8" tile.
  - One of the "2" tiles just tunnelled through the "8" tile!
  - This is inspired by the quantum phenomenon (called tunnelling!) where a particle
    passes through a barrier that it shouldn't be able to cross according to classical
    physics.
  - Quantum tunneling is possible because particles in quantum mechanics behave as
    probabilistic waves, allowing them to have a finite chance of passing through
    energy barriers, even if they lack the classical energy to overcome them.
  - Perform tunnelling merges to fill up the competency counter!
  - You've mastered the tunneling merge! Next, let's learn about merge thresholds.
  - Sometimes, tiles will not be able to merge if their value is not high enough
    for tunnelling to work. .\n
  - Uh-oh! The "2" tiles are not able to tunnel through because their value is not
    high enough.
  - Tiles must have a minimum threshold in order to be able to tunnel through.
  - See? The "16" tile was within the tunneling threshold!
  - You have completed the Tunnelling tutorial!\nYou can now freely play the game
    with tunnelling enabled.\nOnce you're comfortable using tunnelling, hit the Main
